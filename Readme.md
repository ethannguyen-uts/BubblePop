# Description

The game is called BubblePop . In this game, a number of bubbles are randomly displayed on an iOS device screen. A player pops a
bubble by touching the bubble, and every time they pop a bubble they earn a certain number of points.

Bubbles come in five colours: red, pink, green, blue and black. Each colour corresponds to a specific number of points and has a specific probability of appearance (see table 1). All bubbles appear on the screen briefly . A player needs to pop as many bubbles as possible within a certain timeframe (default to 60 seconds) to get high scores. Note that, if a player pops two or more bubbles of the same colour consecutively, they earn 1.5 times
the points for the additional bubbles they pop. Finally, game scores are saved and a high score board is displayed after a game run is finished
